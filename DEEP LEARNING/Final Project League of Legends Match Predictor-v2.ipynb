The model is retrained with these optimizations, and its performance is evaluated on both training and testing sets. \n\n**Weight Decay** :In the context of machine learning and specifically in optimization algorithms, weight_decay is a parameter used to apply L2 regularization to the model's parameters (weights). It helps prevent the model from overfitting by penalizing large weight values, thereby encouraging the model to find simpler solutions.To use L2 regularization, you need to modify the optimizer by setting the weight_decay parameter. The weight_decay parameter in the optimizer adds the L2 regularization term during training.\nFor example, when you initialize the optimizer with optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.01, weight_decay=0.01), the weight_decay=0.01 term applies L2 regularization with a strength of 0.01.\n\n1. Set Up the Optimizer with L2 Regularization:\n   - Modify the optimizer to include `weight_decay` for L2 regularization.\n   - Example:\n     ```python\n     optimizer = optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.01, weight_decay=0.01)\n     ```\n2.

The confusion matrix helps in understanding the classification accuracy, while the ROC curve illustrates the trade-off between sensitivity and specificity.\n\nConfusion Matrix : A Confusion Matrix is a fundamental tool used in classification problems to evaluate the performance of a model. It provides a matrix showing the number of correct and incorrect predictions made by the model, categorized by the actual and predicted classes.\nWhere \n-  True Positive (TP): Correctly predicted positive class (class 1).\n- True Negative (TN): Correctly predicted negative class (class 0).\n- False Positive (FP): Incorrectly predicted as positive (class 1), but the actual class is negative (class 0). This is also called a Type I error.\n- False Negative (FN): Incorrectly predicted as negative (class 0), but the actual class is positive (class 1). This is also called a Type II error. \n\nROC Curve (Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve):\nThe ROC Curve is a graphical representation used to evaluate the performance of a binary classification model across all classification thresholds. It plots two metrics:\n- True Positive Rate (TPR) or Recall (Sensitivity)-It is the proportion of actual positive instances (class 1) that were correctly classified as positive by the model.\n- False Positive Rate (FPR)-It is the proportion of actual negative instances (class 0) that were incorrectly classified as positive by the model.\n  \nAUC: \nAUC stands for Area Under the Curve and is a performance metric used to evaluate the quality of a binary classification model. Specifically, it refers to the area under the ROC curve (Receiver Operating Characteristic curve), which plots the True Positive Rate (TPR) versus the False Positive Rate (FPR) for different threshold values.\n\nClassification Report:\nA Classification Report is a summary of various classification metrics, which are useful for evaluating the performance of a classifier on the given dataset.\n\n#### Exercise 5:  \n\nWrite code to visualize the model's performance using confusion matrices and ROC curves.

Sorting and Plotting Feature Importance:\n  - Sort the features based on the absolute value of their importance (weights) to identify the most impactful features.\n  - Use a bar plot (via `matplotlib`) to visualize the sorted feature importances, with the feature names on the y-axis and importance values on the x-axis.\n\n4.
